## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### 1. **Emergency Repair CTA Position**
**Issue:** Placed after Location Preview, which interrupts the flow
**Better Position:** Should be earlier - right after Hero or after Services
**Reason:** Urgent CTAs should be visible early, not buried mid-page

### 2. **Location Preview Timing**
**Issue:** Appears before Social Proof/Gallery
**Better Position:** After Social Proof or after Gallery
**Reason:** Location is less urgent than seeing work/trust signals

### 3. **Quick Links Position**
**Issue:** Appears after Emergency Repair
**Better Position:** Could be earlier or later, but current position is okay
**Reason:** Navigation links can be anywhere, but flow could be smoother

### 4. **Visual Flow Logic**
**Current:** Information → Trust → Location → Urgent CTA → Navigation
**Better:** Information → Urgent CTA → Trust → Location → Navigation

## 🎯 Reasoning

### Why Move Emergency Repair Earlier?
- **Urgency:** Customers with urgent needs should see this immediately
- **Conversion:** Early visibility = more conversions
- **Flow:** Makes sense after Services (they see what you offer, then urgent CTA)
- **User Intent:** Users looking for urgent repair won't scroll far

### Why Move Location Later?
- **Priority:** Less urgent than trust signals and work examples
- **Flow:** Show work first, then where to find you
- **Logic:** Trust → Proof → Location makes more sense
- **Engagement:** Users who see gallery/reviews are more engaged, then want location
